## ROLL THE DICE GAME

The game is a project included on a javascript course I made, and I added funcitonality to the UI. I hope develop a personal version of the game with new features and a really cool design in the future. Before you play the game read the rules below, then just [Roll The Dice](https://jnosornov.github.io/Roll-To-100-Game/).

#### RULES

**1.** the game has two players, playing in rounds.  
**2.** in each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his round score.  
**3.** if the player rolls a 1, all his round score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.  
**4.** The player can choose to hold, which means that his round score gets added to his global score. After that, it's the next player's turn.  
**5.** the first player to reach 100 points on global score wins the game.
